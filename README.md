# Mini_Meeting_Room_Booking_System
I developed the mini meeting room booking system using HTML,CSS,Javascript
## Overview

The Meeting Room Booking System is a web application that allows users to book available meeting rooms for specific time slots within a workday. This system is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is designed to provide the following features:

- Display Available Rooms: Lists all available meeting rooms with unique names or identifiers. Users can view the current booking status for each room.

- Booking a Room: Users can select a room and choose a time slot in 30-minute increments (e.g., 9:00-9:30, 9:30-10:00) to book it. Once booked, the time slot is marked as unavailable for that specific room.

- Viewing Bookings: Users can view all of their current bookings, displaying the room name and the booked time slot.

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd meeting-room-booking
## Usage

- To book a room, select a room from the list and choose an available time slot.
- To view your bookings, click on the "My Bookings" section.
- To edit or cancel a booking, go to the "My Bookings" section and select the booking you want to modify.
- If you wish to cancel a booking, click the "Cancel Booking" button. Once canceled, the time slot becomes available for others.
## File Structure
index.html: The main HTML file containing the user interface and application logic.
style.css: The CSS file for styling the application.
